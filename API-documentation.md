Editing forms will cause chaos if attendees have already answered questions. If the form is changed then the Question entry can still remain, but the original ordering of the form will be lost. Maybe copy every form/question when it is used in an event?

# API Documentation

For all endpoints where data is restricted, the user must have the appropriate tokens/etc I don't really know atm how this will work (TODO)

## Available to all: 
### 1.	Register for account. 
```POST /v0/attendees``` Working\
```POST /v0/hosts``` Working\

{
	"email": "example@gmail.com",

}
```
Response:
```
{
	"hostID": 32423423
}
```
```
{
	"attendeeID": 42342343
}
```

### 2.	Authenticate.

<!-- For anonymous submissions, the request should leave attendeeID blank/null.\
TODO: problem - the current system would not be able to authenticate attendees' requests for the mood of this feedback, as the attendeeID is not stored alongside anonymous requests. -->
If a user is creating an anonymous response, the line "isAnonymous": true should be included in the answer post request.
