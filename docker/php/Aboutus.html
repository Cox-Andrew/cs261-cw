      Moodlysis is a mood analysis application to be used with live events or a series of live events such as meetings, workshops, presentations. 
      <br><br>
      The event host can create a session for series of events and a meeting for a particular event. The application requires an attendee of the event to provide their feedback on the event. The questions asked in the feedback can be easily customized by the event host. For ease of use, the application provides two template forms for the type of questions that can be asked in the feedback form. 
      <br><br>
      The host can view the mood of the attendees that is calculated on the basis of the feedback provided by them. The mood displayed to the host consists of the general mood based on the general feedback form and a comprehensive mood based on the questions asked by the host in the customized feedback form. 
      <br><br>
      Both the feedbacks are available for the session and a meeting. The feedback for a session displays an average mood of the attendees throughout the session and the feedback for a meeting shows the mood of the attendees during a particular event.
